# Challenge Week #20 - React Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer  
WHEN I view the header  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio  
WHEN I view the navigation titles  
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted  
WHEN I click on a navigation title  
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
